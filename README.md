# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

You’ll learn how to:

Create and use a repository;

Start and manage a new branch;

Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits; and

Open and merge a pull request.

See the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ for details about the tutorial.
